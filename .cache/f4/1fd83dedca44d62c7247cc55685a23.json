There are two sets of notes students take, The first being in-class from discussion and the second at home along with videos and the textbook. Assessmentwise there are daily reading quizzes and unit exams. Class work ranges from activities and practice to hands-on labs. There is a lot of content and a limited amount of time to get through everything.  \r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h4>\r\n        Homework:\r\n      </h4>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Homework consists of reading the text book, watching videos and taking notes on sticky notes to link the two sources of information. These notes are completed prior to discussion in class. \r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h4>\r\n        Materials Required:\r\n      </h4>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Most materials are provided. The only items students need to bring are headphones and sticky notes.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h4>\r\n        Tests & Quizzes:\r\n      </h4>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        There are daily reading quizzes, which are around 10 questions each. There are 9 unit exams in total that are spread out over the semester. These exams are longer, around 40 questions and are written in the AP format. \r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h4>\r\n        Self-Studying:\r\n      </h4>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Being self motivated in this class is very helpful. Students should be reviewing content throughout the course on their own to retain the information in order to be successful on the AP exam. Students in first semester would also want to review on their own prior to the AP exam as well as attending the optional review sessions hosted by the instructor and the county.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h4>\r\n        If your class is AP, please describe the AP exam.\r\n      </h4>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        The exam consists of both multiple choice and free response questions. Students are expected to answer the FRQs directly and concisely. Many people have the misconception that the APES exam is easy. When comparing it to the AP Chemistry or Physics it may be easier, but it is still a difficult exam. Students who are enrolled in the course will be adequately prepared for the exam, as long as they stay focused and attentive in class. \r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>\r\n        If your class is AP, please describe how the Honors and AP experience\r\n        differs from a student's perspective.\r\n      </h4>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        There are several items that make a clear distinction between honors and AP. First, there are completely different unit exams. Honors students have less writing assigments, such as FRQs. The reading quizzes are curved for honors since the questions are at the AP level. There is usually an overall honors curve. Honors students are still expected to do the same style of note taking and class participation. Honors students will participate in all the same labs and activities as well.  \r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h4>\r\n        Please describe any additional information you would like to provide.\r\n      </h4>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Although this is an AP class, the exam isn't the only focus. One of the overall goals as an environmental science course is for students to leave the class as better citizens of the planet.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    \r\n      <h4>Student Responses </h4>\r\n    </div>\r\n  \r\n\r\n    <div class=\"row\">\r\n      <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n        <div class=\"card\">\r\n          <div class=\"comment-widgets m-b-20\">\r\n            <div class=\"d-flex flex-row comment-row\">\r\n              <div class=\"p-2\">\r\n                <span class=\"round\"><img src=\"https://images.nightcafe.studio//assets/profile.png?tr=w-1600,c-at_max\" alt=\"user\" width=\"50\"></span>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div class=\"comment-text w-100\">\r\n                <h5>Student #1</h5>\r\n                <div class=\"comment-footer\">\r\n                  <span class=\"date\"> Sophmore Year AP Student</span>\r\n\r\n                  <span class=\"action-icons\">\r\n                    <a href=\"#\" data-abc=\"true\"><i class=\"fa fa-pencil\"></i></a>\r\n                    <a href=\"#\" data-abc=\"true\"><i class=\"fa fa-rotate-right\"></i></a>\r\n                    <a href=\"#\" data-abc=\"true\"><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"></i></a>\r\n                  </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <p class=\"m-b-5 m-t-10\">\r\n                  I was an AP student that got a 3 on the exam. Ms. Overfield is a teacher that tries to connect with her students. She teaches mainly by assigning videos. The class is among the hardest that you could take in terms of workload, as tests are consistently difficult. She gave a lot of homework every week. These included nightly readings that you were quizzed on the day after, videos she assigned that you got quizzed on, and notes on chapters of the book. I didn't study for the class, but the AP test requires a good amount of studying. If you donâ€™t properly study for it, you will probably fail.\r\n                </p>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n  </div></div></div></div></body>\r\n</html>\r\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"431282ad75cb1dd5a35128b84c40b9cb","cacheData":{}}
